# 🧠 debugging-for-therapy

Welcome to *debugging-for-therapy* — a cozy little corner of code where logic meets laughter, and bugs are just misunderstood features. 🐛✨

This repo is a playground for whatever coding chaos I feel like making — no pressure, no deadlines, just me vibing with a keyboard and writing code that’s fun, weird, or oddly soothing.

## 🤹‍♂️ What's Inside?

Expect anything from:
- 🐍 Silly Python scripts that do... something
- 🧪 Mini experiments and one-liners gone rogue
- 🕹️ Console games that nobody asked for
- 🤖 AI trying to be funny
- 💡 Things that exist just because I could

Basically, this is my digital stress ball.

## 🧘‍♂️ Why?

Coding can be intense. This repo exists because sometimes, writing nonsense code is the best kind of therapy.  
No burnout here. Just bytes and vibes.

## 📦 How to Use

Clone it, run it, laugh (or groan), maybe learn something accidentally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sinaaasghari/debugging-for-therapy.git
cd debugging-for-therapy
